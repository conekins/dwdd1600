        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>In 2024, GAMES4LESS was founded in response to the skyrocketing prices of video games and related equipment. Recognizing that not everyone could afford these high prices, we wanted to ensure that gamers of all backgrounds could enjoy their favorite titles without financial strain. Our founder, Connor Ekins, saw the need for a more inclusive gaming community and was driven by a passion to make gaming accessible to everyone. With this vision in mind, GAMES4LESS was born. We are dedicated to providing affordable options for gamers, ensuring that the joy of gaming can be experienced by all, regardless of budget.
